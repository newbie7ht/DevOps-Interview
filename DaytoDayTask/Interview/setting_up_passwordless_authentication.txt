Setting up passwordless SSH authentication between two virtual machines (VMs) allows you to connect to one VM from another without being prompted for a password. This is typically done using SSH keys. Below are the steps to set up passwordless SSH authentication between two VMs.

Assumptions:
VM1: The machine from which you want to initiate SSH connections (e.g., user@vm1).
VM2: The target machine you want to connect to (e.g., user@vm2).
SSH is already installed on both VMs.
Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair on VM1
Log into VM1:

bash
Copy code
ssh user@vm1
Generate the SSH key pair:

bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
Press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).
If prompted, you can enter a passphrase for added security, but for true passwordless access, leave it blank and press Enter.
Step 2: Copy the Public Key to VM2
Copy the public key to VM2 using ssh-copy-id:

bash
Copy code
ssh-copy-id user@vm2
Replace user@vm2 with the appropriate username and IP address or hostname of VM2.
Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter the password for user@vm2.
Alternatively, if ssh-copy-id is not available, you can manually copy the key:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@vm2 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
Set appropriate permissions on VM2:

After copying the key, ensure that the permissions on VM2 are correct:
bash
Copy code
ssh user@vm2
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
exit
Step 3: Test Passwordless SSH Access
Test the connection from VM1 to VM2:
bash
Copy code
ssh user@vm2
If everything is set up correctly, you should be able to connect without being prompted for a password.
